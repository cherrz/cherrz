# Hi, my name is Dawid and I work as a Test Engineer üëã

### About me and my job ‚¨áÔ∏è

As a Test Engineer with over 2,5 years of experience, I specialize in finding & reporting bugs, creating and executing tests to ensure that products meet high-quality standards, also I can automate basic happy paths on the website with Playwright and TypeScript. 

**Right now I'm mainly dealing with: **
- Coding basic automation tests with Playwright & TS
- Testing backend & API with Postman
- Testing sites, web applications and mobile apps
- Reporting bugs using the Asana & JIRA tools
- Test planning
- Creating test scenarios
- Cooperation with developers

During my work, I have gained a lot of experience in testing different types of applications and systems, both at the front-end and back-end levels. I have worked with various tools such as JIRA and GIT, and have been able to work effectively with the development team to resolve quality issues and ensure the continuous development of our products.

All in all, my work as a QA Engineer has been a great adventure that has allowed me to develop my technical and analytical skills and gain experience in software testing and collaboration with other team members. I am satisfied with my work and know that I will be able to apply this experience to future projects.
